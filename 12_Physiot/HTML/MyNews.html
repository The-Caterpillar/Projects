</center>
On the tape, the interviewer points out that Markle, who married the queen's grandson Prince Harry in 2018, had been critical of Trump during the 2016 presidential campaign, saying "she'd move to Canada if you got elected; turned out she moved here."
"Well, a lot of people are moving here, so what can I say," Trump replied. "No, I didn't know that she was nasty."
And yet he went on to say he thought that as princess "she'll do excellently, she'll be very good, she'll be very good. I hope she does."
'Listen for yourself!'
An official Trump campaign Twitter account had rather bizarrely called attention to the "nasty" comment on Saturday by linking to a video of the interview and suggesting the president had not used the word; it urged people to "Listen for yourself!"
Markle will not be meeting with Trump, though the official reason given is that she remains on maternity leave with her three-week-old son Archie.
Trump further roiled the waters ahead of his visit by weighing in on Britain's unending Brexit woes, throwing his weight behind former foreign secretary Boris Johnson to succeed Prime Minister Theresa May and suggesting Britain should leave the European Union without a departure deal if better terms can't be reached.
The Sun called Trump's remarks a "bombshell intervention" and a "major breach of protocol" by a foreign leader.
The president said he was not giving an outright endorsement to any candidate to lead Britain's ruling Conservative Party, but also said that he liked Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt.
Hunt on Sunday played down any awkwardness over Trump's visit.
"I don't think it's going to disrupt the welcome at all," he said on CBS's "Face the Nation," because the British had learned "from the president that you know regularly we have to agree to disagree...
"It doesn't affect the fact that we have the most important partnership that there is in the world for freedom, democracy, the rule of law."
In addition to Markle's remark about moving to Canada, she had also called Trump "misogynistic" and "divisive" during the 2016 campaign, feelings that a good number of Britons appear to share.
Large anti-Trump protests are expected during his visit, and a huge blimp of Trump as a baby in diapers is being readied to fly over the city if police allow it.
Markle's absence may be conspicuous in one way: Trump is bringing all four of his adult children and their spouses to London and, according to The Sun, said he wants them to hold a "next generation" meeting with Princes William and Harry.
"I think my children will be meeting them," Trump said. "It would be nice.

<b> EARLIER: </b>
<br/> <i>
London (CNN)Less than 24 hours before Donald Trump is set to touch down in the United Kingdom on his first state visit to the country, the US President has sent Britain's political establishment into a spin -- telling the UK it should "walk away" from Brexit talks if the European Union does not give it what it wants.

"If you don't get the deal you want, if you don't get a fair deal, then you walk away," the President told British newspaper the Sunday Times, ahead of his three-day state visit, which kicks off on Monday.
Trump said if he were in the UK's position he "wouldn't pay" the $50 billion Brexit divorce bill, adding "it's a tremendous number."
The President also repeated his suggestion -- previously made to Prime Minister Theresa May -- that the UK should sue the EU. When asked how this would work, Trump said he would have put "on the table" the "mistakes made by the EU that cost the UK a lot of money and a lot of harm."
Trump's visit comes at a delicate time in British politics, with Westminster in a deadlock over Brexit negotiations and the clock ticking towards an October 31 exit date.
Trump: Send in Farage
The President's comments will do nothing to ease May's last days in office, after she announced last month she was stepping down as leader of the governing Conservative Party in light of her failure to deliver on the result of the 2016 Brexit referendum.
Indeed Trump went as far as to say the government should send in the leader of the populist Brexit party, Nigel Farage, to negotiate with Brussels, calling him an "asset to your country."
"I like Nigel a lot and I think he's got a lot to offer," said Trump, adding that Farage was a "really terrific person" who he got to know early in his political career "when he liked my campaign and he actually came to a speech."
