            O YOUTH, sweet comrade Youth, wouldst thou be gone? <br/>
            Long have we dwelt together, thou and I; <br/>
            Together drunk of many an alien dawn, <br/>
            And plucked the fruit of many an alien sky. <br/>
            Ah, fickle friend, must I, who yesterday <br/>
            Dreamed forwards to long, undimmed ecstasy, <br/>
            Henceforward dream, because thou wilt not stay, <br/>
            Backward to transient pleasure and to thee? <br/>
            I give thee back thy false, ephemeral vow; <br/>
            But, O beloved comrade, ere we part, <br/>
            Upon my mournful eyelids and my brow <br/>
            Kiss me who hold thine image in my heart.

        <h3>Sarojini Naidu (née Chattopadhyay; 13 February 1879 - 2 March 1949)</h3> 
        She was an Indian political 
        activist, feminist and poet. A proponent of civil rights, women's emancipation, and 
        anti-imperialistic ideas, she was an important person in India's struggle for independence 
        from colonial rule. She was also the first Indian woman to be the president of the Indian 
        National Congress and to be appointed as governor of an Indian state (United Provinces). <br>
        Naidu's literary work as a poet earned her the sobriquet the <i><b> “Nightingale of India”</i> </b>, 
        or <i><b>“Bharat Kokila”</b></i> by Mahatma Gandhi because of colour, imagery and lyrical quality 
        of her poetry.
        <br/>
        Born in a Bengali family in Hyderabad, Chattopadhyay was educated in Madras, London and Cambridge.
        Following her time in England, where she worked as a suffragist, she was drawn to Indian National
        Congress' movement for India's independence from British rule. She became a part of the India
        nationalist movement and became a follower of Mahatma Gandhi and his idea of swaraj. She married 
        Govindarajulu Naidu, a general physician in 1898. She was appointed the President of the Indian 
        National Congress in 1925 and later became the Governor of the United Provinces in 1947, becoming
        the first woman to hold the office of Governor in the Dominion of India. <br/>
        Naidu's poetry includes both children's poems and others written on more serious themes 
        including patriotism, and tragedy. Published in 1912, <b><i>"In the Bazaars of Hyderabad"</i></b>
        remains one of her most popular poems. <br/>
        <strong>She died of a cardiac arrest on 2 March 1949.</strong>

        College. He held a doctorate of Science from Edinburgh University. Her mother wrote poetry 
        in Bengali. <br/>

        <strong>Early oratory</strong> <br/>
        Beginning in 1904, Naidu became an increasingly popular orator, promoting Indian independence 
        and women's rights, especially women's education. Her oratory often framed arguments 
        following the five-part rhetorical structures of Nyaya reasoning. She addressed the Indian
        National Congress and the Indian Social Conference in Calcutta in 1906. Her social work for
        flood relief earned her the <b><i>Kaisar-i-Hind Medal</i></b> in 1911, which she later returned 
        in protest over the April 1919 Jallianwala Bagh massacre. She met Muthulakshmi Reddy in
        1909, and in 1914 she met Mahatma Gandhi, whom she credited with inspiring a new commitment
        to political action. She was the <b><i>second woman President</i></b> of the Indian National 
        Congress and <i><b>the first Indian woman to preside over the INC conference</b></i>
        <br/><br/>
        With Reddy, she helped established the Women's Indian Association in 1917. Later that
        year, Naidu accompanied her colleague Annie Besant, who was the president of Home Rule League 
        and Women's Indian Association, to advocate universal suffrage in front of the Joint Select 
        Committee in London, United Kingdom. She also supported the Lucknow Pact, a joint Hindu-Muslim 
        demand for British political reform, at the Madras Special Provincial Council. As a public 
        speaker, Naidu's oratory was known for its personality and its incorporation of her poetry.

        Naidu began writing at the age of 12. Her play, Maher Muneer, written in Persian,
        impressed the Nizam of Kingdom of Hyderabad.
        <br/><br/>
        Naidu's poetry was written in english, and usually took the form of lyric poetry in the 
        tradition of British Romanticism, which she was sometimes challenged to reconcile with her 
        Indian nationalist politics. She was known for her vivid use of rich sensory images in her 
        writing, and for her lush depictions of India. She was well-regarded as a poet, 
        considered the <b><I>"Indian Yeats"</I></b>.
        <br/><br/>

        Her first book of poems was published in London in 1905, titled <i><b>"The Golden Threshold"</b></i>.
        The publication was suggested by Edmund Gosse, and bore an introduction by Arthur Symons. 
        
        It also included a sketch of Naidu as a teenager, in a ruffled white dress, drawn by John 
        Butler Yeats. Her second and most strongly nationalist book of poems, The Bird of Time, was 
        published in 1912. It was published in both London and New York, and includes "In the 
        Bazaars of Hyderabad". The last book of new poems published in her lifetime, The Broken 
        Wing(1917) was dedicated to Muhammad Ali Jinnah. It includes the poem "The Gift of India", 
        critiquing the British empire's exploitation of Indian mothers and soldiers, which she had 
        previously recited to the Hyderabad Ladies' War Relief Association in 1915. It also includes 
        "Awake!", with which she concluded a 1915 speech to the Indian National Congress to urge 
        unified Indian action. A collection of all her published poems was printed in New York in 
        1928. After her death, Naidu's complete poems, including unpublished works, were collected 
        in The Feather of the Dawn(1961), edited by her daughter Padmaja Naidu.
